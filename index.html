    <h1>What we do</h1>
    <p>
        When change is mandatory and interventions of Leadership and interim management are not successful it’s time for
        a totally different approach. Traditional, Old School approach by finding compromises and consensice are at
        best, bringing only a part of a (short term) solution and is not sustainable in today’s agile markets.
    </p>
    <p>FTR brings proven - out of the box - sustainable value adding solutions,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>flexibility that enables companies to up- and downscale at anytime without costly
            restructuring costs
        </li>
        <li>performance driven management that is capable to drive and develop the business</li>
        <li>continuous improvement to stay connected with clients, market and company objectives</li>
        <li>improve employer branding, to attract, develop and retain talents</li>
        <li>performance management with clear KPI’s translating to remuneration packages rewarding
            value creation focusing on individual and team performance linked to company results
        </li>
    </ul>

<section id="our-approach" class="section dark-bg">
    <h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <p>In most, if not all, cases we have been involved in, we noticed a lack of</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Competent leadership</li>
        <li>Setting the right priorities</li>
        <li>Engaging and motivating communication</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The above are FTR strongholds, clients find our approach very refreshing, transparent and motivating to work
        with.

        FTR does not offer a ‘one size fits all’ approach, but offers pragmatic, tailor made, value adding solutions
        respecting company legacy and with empathy for the individual employee.

        After defining and agreeing to the change project plan, setting priorities and objectives a project team of hand
        picked SME’s will be appointed.

            <h2 class="text-center">Intake</h2>
            <p>
                Engaging into a company transformation is a demanding and irrevocable process once started. A good
                understanding of the value creation, critical drivers for change and impact on the organization is key
                for a successful implementation. The Intake report provides this clarity by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>defining areas for improvement,</li>
                <li>mapping priorities,</li>
                <li>indicating timelines,</li>
                <li>inventory of (potential) risks,</li>
                <li>indicating Transformation project cost and Transformation related costs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Therefore the Intake report is mandatory before starting any Transformation Project.

                The Intake report cost is a one-off non committing fee, after receiving the Intake report the client is
                free to decide to enter into the next phase, kick-starting the Transformation Project, or not.


                FTR needs – at most - one week on-site assessment to report back on transformation changes needed to
                create the envisioned future organisation.


                Once agreed to the Transformation Plan the next step is creating a KPI driven staged Transformation Plan
                focusing on Management Assessment.

            <h2 class="text-center">Management assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Present company status is a direct result of decisions taken by management anticipating on market- and
                customers dynamics, economy and linked to company strategy.
                As company future state and results are a concern, it makes sense to assess the competence and
                capabilities of senior management, middle management and to see if there is alignment
                of Board of Directors, Sr. Management, Head of Departments, Works Council, Unions, on the envisioned way
